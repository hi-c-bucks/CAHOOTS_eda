# CAHOOTS Diversion Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the proportion of CAD calls in Eugene, Oregon that were diverted from Eugene PD to CAHOOTS. The goal is to understand what the value of the proportion is and how this proportion changed over time, particularly before and after the onset of COVID-19.

## Project Structure
- `cahoots_proj.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning and analysis.
- Used 'call_data_from_CAD.csv' for data analysis.

## Setup & Dependencies
This project was written in Python 3.9 using Jupyter Notebook. The following Python libraries are used:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`

All packages can be installed using pip if needed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```
## How to Run
